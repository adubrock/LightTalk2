==========

Lightning Talk 2 for PCS Ruby Class

1. Added slide files to repo

2. Added two gists:
  * [LT2.rb](https://gist.github.com/adubrock/7307851) -- the feature gist for the talk 
  * [LT2.Interactive.Ex.md](https://gist.github.com/adubrock/7307948) -- the interactive example that goes along with the feature gist. 

3. I also uploaded the two files (LT2.rb and LT2.interactive.Ex.md) to the repo for good measure.
